# Task-7--Extensions
Cybersecurity Internship - Task- Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions


# Objective
The main goal of this task is to **identify, evaluate, and remove any suspicious or unnecessary browser extensions**. This improves browser performance and strengthens security by eliminating potential attack vectors.

# Tools Used
- Web Browser: Google Chrome (You can also use Firefox or others)
- Extension Manager (Built into the browser)
- Google Search (for researching extensions)
- Optional: Extension permission checker websites

## Open Extension Manager

- Opened Google Chrome.
- Navigated to `chrome://extensions/` to access all installed extensions.

## Reviewed All Installed Extensions

- Checked each extensionâ€™s:
  - Name and functionality.
  - Description and developer.
  - Number of downloads and user reviews.
  - Date last updated.

## Checked Permissions

- Identified extensions with **excessive permissions** (e.g., access to "read and change all your data on websites you visit").
- Noted which extensions access personal data or browsing activity.

## Identified Suspicious Extensions

- Looked for:
  - Generic names (e.g., "PDF Tool", "Helper").
  - No clear source or website.
  - Poor reviews or ratings.
  - Unknown developer or no listed contact.

## Removed Unnecessary/Suspicious Extensions

- Clicked **Remove** on extensions deemed risky or not in use.
- Noted names of extensions removed.

## Restarted Browser

- Fully restarted Chrome to ensure changes took effect.
- Checked for performance improvements.

## Researched Security Risks

- Learned how malicious extensions can:
  - Steal passwords or cookies.
  - Track browsing activity.
  - Inject ads or phishing links.


# Suspicious Extensions Found and Removed

| Extension Name | Reason for Removal |
|----------------|--------------------|
| ExampleTool123 | Unknown source, excessive permissions |
| Video Helper   | Poor reviews, requested access to all websites |


# Key Concepts Learned

- How browser extensions can pose **security threats**.
- Importance of **reviewing permissions** before installing.
- Difference between **extensions and plugins**.
- Concept of **sandboxing** and how modern browsers restrict malicious behavior.
